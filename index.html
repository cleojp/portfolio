        <p class="intro">
            My name is Cleo! A Jersey-raised Wolverine passionate about connecting others through design & technology. Currently an Undergraduate studying UX/UI Design & Spanish @ the University of Michigan.
        </p>
        <h2>Behind My Artwork</h2>
        <p>
            This portfolio provides a closer look at artwork, including graphic design, photography, and sculpture, that I've completed over the past 4 years. While I've always leaned towards the creative fields, during my freshman year of high school I took a class
            called Commercial Design, which is when I was first introduced to Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. I fell in love. Afterwards, I took AP 2-Dimensional Design and AP 3-Dimensional Design in high school in which I created concentrations, one
            focused on architectural story telling (See examples in 2D Artwork) and the other on still movement (See examples in 3D Artwork). A few other pieces, including photography and pieces created at UMichigan, are scattered throughout. Enjoy!
        </p>
        <h2>More About Me</h2>
        <p>
            People often ask me, “Why UX Design and Spanish?” Although it may not be the traditional combo, it’s simple: I love connecting with others. Both degrees offer me the opportunity to empathize with people whether that be trying to put myself in the user’s
            shoes as I design a new interface or to learn from another culture through language. Following my love for people, in the future I hope to design more usable technology that is both accessible and looks great. At the end of the day, technology
            is nothing without its users, which is why they should come first.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next summer I will be working at Accenture in the Detroit office within their Interactive Development branch. As a company that prides itself on “reimagining business through experience,” I cannot imagine a better group of innovative people to be learning
            from and working with as I embark on my UX career. As someone who has done work in consulting, marketing, graphic design, and digital strategy, I'm excited to combine all of these experiences along with my studies with the School of Information
            to start designing tech solutions for clients.
